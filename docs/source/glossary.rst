   scanner
        Term to refer to the process that measures the relays' bandwidth.
        It is also called :term:`generator` when it is the same tool that is
        used to generate :term:`bandwidth list file` s.

   generator
        Term to refer to the tool that generates the
        :term:`bandwidth list file` s. Often used as a synomym for
        :term:`scanner`.

        The ``sbws`` command used to run ``sbws`` as a :term:`generator`.
